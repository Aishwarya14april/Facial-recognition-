# FACIAL RECOGNITION

***The Challenge
Face Recognition Challenge
To develop a browser-based application to demonstrate the application of Face Recognition technology.***


A facial recognition software captures and compares patterns on a person’s face and analyses the details to identify and verify the individual. While the underlying system is complex, the whole technology can be broken down into three steps:

>1.)Face Detection: An essential step is locating human faces in real-time

>2.)Transform Data: Once captured, the analogue facial information is transformed into a set of data or vectors based on a person’s facial features

>3.)Face Match: The system matches the data above with the one in the database for verification

## HAAR CASCADES ALGORITHM:
  
  Haar cascade is an algorithm that can detect objects in images, irrespective of their scale in image and location.
  Haar cascade uses the cascading window, and it tries to compute features in every window and classify whether it could be an object.
  Sample haar features traverse in window-sized across the picture to compute and match features.

Haar cascade works as a classifier. It classifies positive data points → that are part of our detected object and negative data points → that don’t contain our object.

  ### Benefits:
  
  *Haar cascades are fast and can work well in real-time.*
  
  *Simple to implement, less computing power required.*
